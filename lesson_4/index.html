      <p>Berlin was built along the banks of the Spree river, which flows into the Havel in the western borough of Spandau. The city includes lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, the largest of which is M√ºggelsee. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks and gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes.</p>
